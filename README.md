# 1. Business Context.

Dirk Rossmann GmbH is one of the largest drug store chains in Europe with around 56,200 employees and over â‚¬10 billion annual revenue in Germany, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Turkey, Albania, Kosovo and Spain. 

The scope of this project is based on a CFO demand: stores will be renovated, and for that, the budget needs to be aligned with each store's sales. Adding to that, it was requested to predict each store sales for the following 6 weeks.

In this context, this project intends to provide the management team with a 6 week store sales prediciton.

## 1.1 Project Deliverables.

In this business context, as a data scientist, I intend to develop a machine learning model that predicts the 6 weeks sales per store.
 
With this model, the management team (including the CFO) will be able to manage the stores renovations.

A report with the following analysis is the deliverable goals:
